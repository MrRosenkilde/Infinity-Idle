# Infinity Idle

This is a hobby project i worked on to practice practice making native applications in Java, it's developed with JavaFX GUI framework and with Eclipse as the IDE. Clone the repository to Eclipse and run it in eclipse to play it.

The program is an Idle game that procedurally generates new content for the player to unlock.
The basis is that you can click a button to generate Score, Score can be spend on items that passively generate more score,
The player can choose to upgrade their current items or focus on buying more of the same item to unlock new upgrades, or focus on buying the next item.
There's also reset currency that the player gains based on their score. In order to get the reset currency the player has to reset all their progress to get resetcurrency that will unlock powerfull upgrades, and also give a 2% income increase per reset currency not spend.
When the player has unlocked one reset currency tier, another tier will be generated giving the player access to even more powerfull upgrades.
