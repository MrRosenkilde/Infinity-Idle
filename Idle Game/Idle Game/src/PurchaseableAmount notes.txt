the price formular is:
y = basecost * (priceIncrease^(newAmount+amount) - priceIncrease^(amount) ) / priceIncrease-1

to isolate newAmount, which is the purchaseAble amount, we do the following operations
y / basecost = ( priceIncrease^(newAmount+amount) - priceIncrease^amount ) / priceIncrease -1
=>
(y / baseCost) * (priceIncrease -1) = priceIncrease^newAmount+amount - priceIncrease^amount
=>
(y / baseCost) * (priceIncrease -1) + priceIncrease^amount = priceIncrease^newAmount+amount
=>
(y / baseCost) * (priceIncrease -1) + priceIncrease^amount = priceIncrease^newAmount * priceIncrease ^amount
=>
(y / baseCost) * (priceIncrease -1) + priceIncrease^amount ) / priceIncrease^amount = priceIncrease^newAmount

=> (see assignmentpoint source for this step)

log-priceIncrease(
 (y / baseCost) * (priceIncrease -1) + priceIncrease^amount ) / priceIncrease^amount
) = newAmount
=> (see giannistsakiris source for this step)
log10(
 (y / baseCost) * (priceIncrease -1) + priceIncrease^amount ) / priceIncrease^amount
) / log10(priceIncrease) = newAmount
